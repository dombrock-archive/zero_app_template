# zero_app_template
A simple template for creating web apps that is designed "mobile first" but looks great on desktops as well. This template is designed to ensure that the content will display in a very similar fashion regardless of resolution or aspect ratio. It aims to use a minimal amount of media queries and is written in pure standard HTML and CSS, this project uses no JS and has no external dependencies. 

This template attempts to loosely follow the Material Design Standards. Here you can see the general layout and how it handles failed resources like a missing image. 
 
###NOTE:
 
This template was originally developed for use with PhoneGap and Apache Cordova and should be fully compatable with both of these technologies.

The navigation is all located in a pull-out side bar. On desktop the sidebar is accessed by hovering over the left edge of the screen or the red tab on the top left. On mobile it is pulled out by touching the left side of the screen once and it is hidden by touching anything aside from the sidebar. This is achieved with minimal CSS and no scripting.
